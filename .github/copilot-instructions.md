# GitHub Copilot Repository Instructions

## Quick Rules

- Use this file as a map, not the full manual
- Start with `docs/agents/README.md` and then open only the linked docs needed for the current decision
- Treat `docs/specs/<feature>/` as the feature system of record
- Use `docs/agents/RLM.md` when full-context loading would be noisy or wasteful
- Keep context minimal and source-attributed

## Pasted Text Attachments

- If the user message includes an attached pasted-text file and the visible message is empty or minimal, treat the attachment as the active task instructions unless the user says otherwise
- If the attachment appears Kit-generated, follow it directly without asking what the attachment is for

## Runtime Routing

- `docs/agents/README.md` — classify the task and choose the next document
- `docs/agents/WORKFLOWS.md` — workflow and source-of-truth rules
- `docs/agents/GUARDRAILS.md` — hard completion and safety rules
- `docs/agents/RLM.md` — just-in-time context routing
- `docs/agents/TOOLING.md` — skills, dispatch, project-directory workflow, and secondary inputs

## Work Lane Mutation Hard Gate

- Before any coding-agent repository file or delivery mutation, including issue, branch, staging, commit, push, worktree, and pull-request mutations, load `docs/agents/GUARDRAILS.md` and `work-lane-gating` first, complete read-only safety recon, then ask exactly: "Before I make any repository changes, should I create a new GitHub issue, GH-<issue-number> branch, canonical worktree, and pull request for this work, or continue in the existing branch/worktree and land it through that branch's pull request?"
- Wait for the explicit choice and record a Pull-Request Landing Plan covering the repository, issue, branch, canonical non-primary worktree, protected base, and create-or-update PR target. Verify that plan still matches before every mutation. Never infer the choice from clean state or a generic PR request.
- Treat the primary/root checkout as read-only. If an ungated or root change exists, preserve it: Do not stage, commit, push, stash, reset, clean, discard, or silently transfer it.


## Testing And Validation Gate

- Before implementation or validation, including browser automation and browser testing, load `docs/references/rules/testing-and-environment-validation.md` and the project's `docs/references/testing.md`
- Preserve language-native code-level tests and pull-request checks; end-to-end and live-integration suites supplement rather than replace them

## GitHub Delivery Hard Gate

- In Kit-managed projects, issue, branch, staging, commit, push, and PR actions are mutation boundaries
- Before any GitHub delivery mutation, load `docs/agents/GUARDRAILS.md` and the relevant `docs/references/rules/*` delivery rules
- Repo-local Kit rules outrank global GitHub/plugin defaults; do not use generic branches, commits, PR bodies, or draft defaults when Kit defines the contract

## GitHub Merge Authorization Hard Gate

- Merge is a distinct mutation boundary. PR-delivery consent, automatic lane allocation, approval, check success, subagent assignment, and a program ledger never imply merge consent.
- Merge only after a direct user request or accepted bounded merge plan names the exact authorized PR set.
- Before any merge or merge-queue mutation, resolve `pull-request-merge` and load `docs/references/rules/github-pr-merge.md`.
- Reconcile the authorization source, authenticated actor, expected head/base, repository merge policy, current reviews/checks, dependencies, and infrastructure or deployment effects before every wave.
- Only exact current `MERGE_READY` nodes may merge. Pending, missing, stale-head, or policy-ineligible skipped checks are not passing.
- Revalidating an authorized target does not require another prompt. Adding a target or materially changing actor, method, environment, infrastructure effect, or recovery requires follow-up authorization.
- Never bypass protection, reviews, required checks, a merge queue, repository policy, or identity safeguards.
- Report merge, hosted workflow, deployment/runtime, and production evidence as separate claims.

## Cross-Repository Program Coordination Gate

- Before implementing or resuming an accepted plan that spans multiple repositories and includes dependent deliverables, staged deployment or activation, or expected agent or session handoff, load `docs/references/rules/cross-repository-program-coordination.md`.
- Designate one coordinator repository and create or adopt one canonical `docs/programs/<program>/PROGRAM.md` ledger before implementation; participant repositories remain authoritative for local specs, delivery state, runbooks, and evidence.
- Dispatch only the reconciled ready frontier, checkpoint every material transition and handoff, and reconcile recorded claims against live repositories, GitHub, runtime, and validation evidence before resume or completion.

## Infrastructure Change Approval Hard Gate

- Before mutating public-cloud resources, Kubernetes resources or cluster state, or infrastructure-as-code source, configuration, or state, load `docs/references/rules/infrastructure-change-approval.md`.
- Read-only discovery may precede confirmation only when it does not alter cloud resources, Kubernetes objects, remote state, or repository-owned infrastructure source.
- Put one consolidated outline of the target context, resource actions, execution boundary, material impact and risk, rollback or recovery, and validation evidence into the task plan when planning is used; otherwise present it once before the first covered mutation. Obtain one explicit user confirmation for the complete bounded batch.
- Approval of a task plan containing the complete outline counts as confirmation. A sufficiently detailed initial request may also count only when it clearly authorizes the exact bounded batch and the batch does not delete or remove infrastructure.
- Deleting, destroying, or removing infrastructure always requires explicit confirmation after the consolidated outline, even when the initial request asked for it; one confirmation covers every deletion named in that batch.
- After confirmation, execute the exact approved batch and continue the rest of the task to completion in one pass without routine command-by-command approval.
- If additional covered infrastructure changes become necessary, collect all then-known changes into one follow-up outline, obtain one confirmation, and execute that follow-up batch in one pass. Do not re-confirm actions already included in an approved batch.
- Treat a material change to target identity, environment, region or cluster, resource set, action type, impact, or recovery as a follow-up batch; compatible tools, commands, and retries inside the approved boundary do not require another prompt.

## AWS Context Hard Gate

- If .kit.yaml defines an enabled aws context, run kit aws verify before the first AWS-dependent command in a task and again immediately before any AWS mutation
- Use the verified configured profile explicitly for every AWS-dependent command, including AWS CLI, SDK, Terraform, CDK, deployment, and project scripts, where supported
- After verification, never use default, another discovered profile, or ambient credentials
- Treat the verified account and ARN as authoritative; on missing credentials, incomplete config, or mismatch, stop and follow docs/agents/GUARDRAILS.md instead of falling back to another profile or default

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Repo-local docs under `docs/` are the source of truth
- Always update affected documentation and keep touched docs properly formatted
- Keep context minimal and load only the docs and files relevant to the task
- Remove dead code and unnecessary exports or public surface when they are not strictly needed
- Do not treat `.claude/skills` as canonical discovery input
- Do not add an always-loaded monolithic instruction file

## Repo Knowledge Map

- `docs/agents/README.md` — repo-local entrypoint
- `docs/agents/WORKFLOWS.md` — work classification and execution flow
- `docs/agents/RLM.md` — progressive-disclosure pattern for broad discovery
- `docs/agents/TOOLING.md` — skills, dispatch, project-directory workflow, and secondary globals
- `docs/agents/GUARDRAILS.md` — hard rules and completion bar
- `docs/references/README.md` — durable repo-local references
- `docs/specs/<feature>/SPEC.md` — v2 feature source of truth
